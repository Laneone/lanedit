This is the Lanedit Readme.
The package is broken into two parts, the Client and the Server.
The client (Lanedit)was written in Java and is the actual text editor.
The server (LanCloud) was wriiten in python and can be run from Google App Engine, and also it is used to run the upload/download part of the client.

The client can be compiled by a simple "javac Lanedit.java" in the source directory.

In order to run it, you either have to be on Linux, with a bash terminal accessible. Or you need to be on windows with Cygwin environment and bash accessible in the PATH.
then just run it with "java Lanedit" 

You'll have to make an account at http://lanclouder.appspot.com/
"lanclouder" was the only available id I could use on App Engine.
"LanCloud" is the actual server package written in python.

If you see any bugs please mail it to me at castlelokesh@gmail.com or use the one in my git profile.
